DEMO A: Multiple tool calls in a single assistant turn
================================================================================
USER: Are there more i's than s's in 'Mississippi riverboats'? Use tools and give both counts.
ASSISTANT: In the phrase "Mississippi riverboats," there are 5 occurrences of the letter 'i' and 5 occurrences of the letter 's'. Therefore, there are not more 'i's than 's's; they are equal.

================================================================================
DEMO B: Sequential chaining (count -> count -> (calc) -> sin)
================================================================================
USER: What is the sin of the difference between the number of i's and the number of s's in 'Mississippi riverboats'? Use tools.
ASSISTANT: The sin of the difference between the number of i's and the number of s's in "Mississippi riverboats" is 0.0.

================================================================================
DEMO C: Query that uses ALL tools
================================================================================
USER: Using tools only:
1) Compute distance (miles) between Richmond, VA and Charlottesville, VA.
2) Count i's and s's in 'Mississippi riverboats'.
3) Let k = i_count - s_count. Use calculator_tool to compute k.
4) Compute sin(k) using sin_tool.
Return a short summary with distance, counts, k, and sin(k).
ASSISTANT: Here's the summary of the computations:

1. **Distance between Richmond, VA and Charlottesville, VA**: 66.1 miles
2. **Count of 'i' in 'Mississippi riverboats'**: 5
3. **Count of 's' in 'Mississippi riverboats'**: 5
4. **k (i_count - s_count)**: 0
5. **sin(k)**: 0.0

If you need any further information, feel free to ask!

================================================================================
DEMO D: Try to hit 5-turn outer loop limit (one tool per step + recursion_limit=5)
================================================================================
USER: Do this strictly one step at a time, using exactly ONE tool call per step, and wait for results:
1) Count letter 'i' in 'Mississippi riverboats'
2) Count letter 's' in 'Mississippi riverboats'
3) Use calculator_tool to compute k = i_count - s_count
4) Compute sin(k) using sin_tool
5) List I-64 cities
If you get cut off, say where you stopped.
ASSISTANT: [Stopped] Hit recursion limit = 5 before finishing.
